# BOFE

**Bofe is a [unofficial] integration with Argentina's official bulletin (Bolet√≠n Oficial).**

Since there is no documented API for using the search on the official site, we have to figure out a way to parse results obtained from the search to create integrations with other services.

This is a Rust port of a [python script](https://github.com/Atixx/BOFE) for learning purposes

## Usage
